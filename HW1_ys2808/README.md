1.set up a local file named gittest_ys2808 in my computer,and touch a new text. and then set up a file named the same in github. then link them through 'git remote add'. and then git push the file<br />
2.make some change to the local txt document, git add,git commit and git push it to github<br />
3.make some change by editting directly on github's txt documents, then make different change in local txt documents, try to push ,make comflicts. then pull the documents from github, edit through emacs, and add commit,push again, merging two conflicting documents.<br />
4.go someone else's , A's documents to fork them.then go back to my github A's repository, and clone the directory to my local computer.edit the txt in my local documents and then push it to  A's repository in my github.then ask for a new pull request.<br />
