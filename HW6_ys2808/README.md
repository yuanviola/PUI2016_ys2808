ASSIGNMENT 1:

I try to download from Pluto dataset and upload through Jupyter. But after unzip, one of the document is bigger than 25 MB. Then I tried to use green environment to directly download into cusp computer, but don't know why, green env log out always. I cannot use it. Then I use terminal to download. The command is:
wget "https://~~~~~.zip"    this is for download
unzip ~~~.zip -d name_of_directory      this is for unzip
then it works!
PS:in order to use pluto document, it is not enough to only upload .shp document, the whole directory needs uploading

After reading all the data the processing is quite smooth.
The most important experience here for future is to use [mask] and [~mask]to choose negative group. use to_numeric is also a very good way to tranfer str in dataframe into float, if there is not only numeric str in df, by using errors='ignore' or errors='coerce' to ignore str or transfer str into NaN.

# FBB you did a report on the wrong exercise!
you were supposed to do a report on the citibike project you designed for homework 3, not on the citibike analysis I assigned.
