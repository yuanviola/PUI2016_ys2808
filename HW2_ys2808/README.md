#### json file, plot data

Assignment 1 and 2 is bymyself, Assignment 3 is with help of Yao Wang, and Extra Credit is with Henry Lynn

In Assignment 1,I got stuck by somewhere , because under ['OnwardCalls'] there is a key named ['OnwardCall'] but sometimes the bus get lost in signal probably, I cannot retrieve the json data under ['OnwardCalls'] . So if I want to read what is in ['OnwardCall'], I failed always. It took me long time to debug here, by setting up 'if' to judge.

Assignment 2 got pretty easy after assignment 1.

Assignment 3 I firstly choose data as column, but later found out I cannot make a scatter map from that data. Then I still don't know with same data, I can make a Plot map but not a Scatter one.

Extra, Henry helped me to use plt.plot_date to make a scatter map with date data, rather than plt.scatter
