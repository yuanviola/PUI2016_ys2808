This home work is about get information from unknown data. Find out the outlier to know something must happen at that time. And find out what happened indeed. It is quite meaningful and interesting. </br>
The third part is also really meaningful, to find out the periodic pattern of the ridership. I found out that 4.31 week is the most strong period of the ridership, which means a month is a ridership circle. Before, I thought year(52 weeks) could be the strongest pattern. But indeed month is.

Extra credit, I clustered it. But actually I have to flatten station and cards information to do the cluster. So even if I could separate the data into different groups, but I don't know each point represents which station and which card types. So not much information from groups.
